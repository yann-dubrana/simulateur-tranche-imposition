# Tax Simulator Application

This application was created as a simple and fast tax simulator that allows individuals to determine which tax bracket is most advantageous for their specific situation. 

## About
The application idea sprouted from a Reddit post that questioned the understanding of tax brackets in France. The operating principle is simple: input your taxable income and the number of parts you hold, and the application takes care of the rest. It's capable of handling general cases, providing helpful insights into your tax situation. 

Going forward, there are plans to include personalized grids for better precision.
